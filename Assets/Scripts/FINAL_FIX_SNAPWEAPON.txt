FINAL FIX FOR CharacterAnimationController.cs
==============================================

PROBLEM:
Lines 226-229 have duplicate variable declarations and reference non-existent 'ikSetup'

SOLUTION:
Open CharacterAnimationController.cs and manually delete lines 226-229

WHAT TO DELETE (lines 226-229):
--------------------------------
		if (ikSetup == null || ikSetup.Grip == null)
			return;

		Transform actualGrip = ikSetup.Grip;


AFTER DELETION:
---------------
Line 224 should be:
		Transform actualGrip = _weapons.CurrentWeapon.LeftHandTarget;

Line 225 should be blank

Line 226 should be:  (this was line 231 before)
		if (actualGrip != null)


QUICK STEPS:
------------
1. Open: Assets/TPSBR/Scripts/Gameplay/Agent/Character/CharacterAnimationController.cs
2. Go to line 226
3. Delete 4 lines (226, 227, 228, 229)
4. Save the file
5. Unity will recompile - all errors should be gone!


VERIFICATION:
-------------
After the fix, the SnapWeapon method around line 224 should look like this:

	Transform actualGrip = _weapons.CurrentWeapon.LeftHandTarget;

	if (actualGrip != null)
	{
		_leftHand.SetPositionAndRotation(actualGrip.position, actualGrip.rotation);
		...
	}

That's it! This will fix all remaining compilation errors.
