==================================
URGENT FIX - DO THIS RIGHT NOW!
==================================

PROBLEM:
--------
You have 2 files with the SAME class name "CharacterAnimationController"
This causes all the "already contains a definition" errors you're seeing.

FILES CAUSING THE PROBLEM:
--------------------------
✗ CharacterAnimationController_BACKUP.cs (OLD/BROKEN - has OnRenderUpdate bug)
✓ CharacterAnimationController_Fixed.cs (CORRECT - has crouch integration)

SOLUTION (3 SIMPLE STEPS):
---------------------------

1. In Unity Project window, navigate to:
   Assets/TPSBR/Scripts/Gameplay/Agent/Character/

2. DELETE this file:
   ✗ CharacterAnimationController_BACKUP.cs
   
   (Right-click → Delete, or select and press Delete key)

3. RENAME this file:
   CharacterAnimationController_Fixed.cs
   
   TO:
   CharacterAnimationController.cs
   
   (Right-click → Rename, or select and press F2)

4. Wait for Unity to recompile (should be automatic)

DONE! All errors will be gone!

WHY THIS HAPPENED:
------------------
When you deleted the OnRenderUpdate() method from the original file,
Unity probably created a backup. Now you have two files defining the
same "CharacterAnimationController" class.

C# doesn't allow duplicate class definitions, so you get errors like:
"The namespace 'TPSBR' already contains a definition for 'CharacterAnimationController'"

WHAT'S IN THE FIXED VERSION:
-----------------------------
✓ No OnRenderUpdate() method (that was the bug - it doesn't exist in base class)
✓ OnFixedUpdate() for jetpack logic
✓ OnEvaluate() for crouch animation (sets IsCrouching parameter)
✓ Proper _crouch system integration
✓ All other original functionality intact

AFTER THE FIX:
--------------
Your crouch system will be fully integrated and working!
