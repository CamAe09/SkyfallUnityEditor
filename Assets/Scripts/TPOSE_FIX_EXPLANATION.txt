🔴 T-POSE PROBLEM - CRITICAL EXPLANATION
================================================================================

WHY YOU'RE T-POSING:
====================

The PlayerController.controller you added is COMPLETELY EMPTY!

TPSBR does NOT use Unity's standard Animator Controller system.
Instead, it uses a custom code-based animation system called
"Fusion AnimationController Addon".


WHAT YOU DID (Wrong Approach):
===============================

1. Added empty PlayerController.controller to Marine prefab
2. This replaced the game's custom animation system  
3. Result: No animations = T-pose everywhere
4. Dead body issues = Animation system not running properly


THE REAL ANIMATION SYSTEM:
===========================

TPSBR uses these components for animations:

✅ CharacterAnimationController (script-based, NOT Animator Controller)
   - Located: /Assets/TPSBR/Scripts/Gameplay/Agent/Character/CharacterAnimationController.cs
   - This is a MonoBehaviour that extends Fusion.Addons.AnimationController
   - Manages ALL character animations through code
   - Handles: walking, running, jumping, shooting, death, etc.

✅ Animator component (Unity built-in)
   - Must be attached but WITHOUT a controller
   - The CharacterAnimationController drives it programmatically
   - Plays animations by direct API calls

✅ Animation Clips (FBX files)
   - Individual animation files
   - CharacterAnimationController references these directly in code
   - NO animator controller asset needed!


HOW TPSBR ANIMATIONS WORK:
===========================

Traditional Unity Approach (NOT used here):
  GameObject → Animator → Animator Controller → States → Clips

TPSBR Approach (What it actually uses):
  GameObject → Animator (no controller!)
             → CharacterAnimationController (script)
             → Animation Layers (defined in code)
             → Animation States (defined in code)
             → Animation Clips (referenced in code)


WHY THE CROUCH TOOL WON'T WORK:
================================

The tool I created was designed to:
  ✅ Add crouch states to a Unity Animator Controller
  ✅ Create blend trees
  ✅ Set up parameters and transitions

BUT TPSBR doesn't use Animator Controllers!

Instead, you need to:
  ❌ Don't use the animator controller tool
  ✅ Modify CharacterAnimationController.cs to add crouch layers
  ✅ Create new AnimationLayer classes in code
  ✅ Reference crouch animation clips directly


WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO FIX T-POSE:
===================================

STEP 1: Remove the Wrong Controller
------------------------------------
1. Open Marine.prefab
2. Select the root Marine GameObject
3. Inspector → Find Animator component
4. Set Controller field to: None (clear it!)
5. Keep the Animator component (don't remove it!)
6. Save prefab


STEP 2: Verify CharacterAnimationController Exists
---------------------------------------------------
1. Still in Marine prefab Inspector
2. Look for "Character Animation Controller" component
3. If it's there: ✅ Good!
4. If it's missing: Add Component → CharacterAnimationController


STEP 3: Test Without Controller
--------------------------------
1. Save the Marine prefab
2. Enter Play mode
3. Your character should now animate properly!
4. Walk, run, jump = animations work
5. No more T-posing!


ADDING CROUCH PROPERLY (Code-Based Approach):
==============================================

You cannot use the animator controller tool I created.
Instead, you need to modify the C# code.

Option 1: Modify CharacterAnimationController (Advanced)
---------------------------------------------------------
This requires understanding the Fusion AnimationController system.

You would need to:
1. Create a new CrouchLayer class (extends AnimationLayer)
2. Add crouch states (CrouchIdle, CrouchWalk)
3. Register the layer in CharacterAnimationController
4. Handle crouch transitions in code
5. Update the layer based on crouch input


Option 2: Use Existing Locomotion Layer (Simpler)
--------------------------------------------------
The game likely already has a locomotion layer that handles
walking/running. You could:

1. Add crouch animations to the existing locomotion
2. Modify the locomotion layer to blend between stand/crouch
3. Control via IsCrouching parameter


Option 3: Wait for Proper Implementation
-----------------------------------------
Implementing crouch in this system is complex and requires:
- Understanding Fusion addon architecture
- Modifying existing animation code
- Testing network synchronization
- Ensuring compatibility with existing systems


IMMEDIATE FIX:
==============

Right now, just focus on getting your character working again:

1. ✅ REMOVE PlayerController.controller from Marine's Animator
2. ✅ KEEP the Animator component (just clear the Controller field)
3. ✅ VERIFY CharacterAnimationController component exists
4. ✅ SAVE and test

Your character will work perfectly, just without crouch yet.


WHY YOU SAW THOSE SPECIFIC ISSUES:
===================================

T-posing while falling:
  - No "Fall" animation state active
  - Empty controller = no states = T-pose

Permanent T-pose:
  - Empty controller = no locomotion states
  - CharacterAnimationController disabled/replaced

Head floating on death:
  - No "Dead" animation playing
  - Body ragdoll may activate but head stays
  - Death animation system not running


THE CORRECT SETUP:
==================

Marine Prefab ROOT GameObject should have:

✅ Transform
✅ Animator (Controller = None!)
✅ CharacterAnimationController (script)
✅ Agent (script)
✅ Weapons (script)
✅ KCC (Kinematic Character Controller)
✅ NetworkObject (Fusion networking)
... other game components


WHAT THE EMPTY PlayerController.controller CONTAINS:
=====================================================

File: /Assets/TPSBR/PlayerController.controller

Contents: NOTHING! It's empty!
  - No layers
  - No states  
  - No parameters
  - No blend trees
  - No transitions

This is why you T-posed!


SUMMARY:
========

Problem:
  You added an empty Animator Controller to a system
  that doesn't use Animator Controllers.

Solution:
  Remove the controller reference, keep the Animator component,
  and let CharacterAnimationController handle everything.

Crouch:
  Cannot be added via Animator Controller tool.
  Must be implemented in C# code within the Fusion system.


NEXT STEPS:
===========

1. Remove PlayerController.controller from Marine's Animator
2. Verify CharacterAnimationController is present
3. Test - animations should work!
4. If you still want crouch:
   - Ask me to help modify CharacterAnimationController.cs
   - I'll need to integrate crouch into the code-based system
   - This is a much more complex implementation


================================================================================
Remove the controller reference from Animator component to fix T-pose!
