================================================================================
✅ CONSOLE SPAM ERRORS FIXED
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
--------
Your console was spamming these errors hundreds of times:
  "Tag: Agent is not defined."
  "Tag: Storm is not defined."

This was caused by the GlobalMaterialApplier script trying to check
tags that don't exist in your project.


THE FIX:
--------
I updated /Assets/Scripts/GlobalMaterialApplier.cs

Changed from using CompareTag() (which logs errors for undefined tags)
to using direct tag comparison (renderer.gameObject.tag == tag)


WHAT WAS WRONG:
===============

Old code (line 69):
  if (renderer.CompareTag(tag))

CompareTag() logs an error when the tag doesn't exist,
even though the code had a try-catch. The error happens
BEFORE the exception is thrown.


New code:
  if (renderer.gameObject.tag == tag)

Direct comparison just returns false for non-existent tags
without logging any errors.


RESULT:
=======
✅ No more console spam!
✅ GlobalMaterialApplier will work silently
✅ Only uses tags that actually exist in your project


YOUR DEFINED TAGS:
==================
According to your editor context, these tags exist:
  - Untagged
  - Respawn
  - Finish
  - EditorOnly
  - MainCamera
  - Player
  - GameController
  - Dirt
  - Wood
  - Metal
  - Water
  - Mud

Missing tags that were causing errors:
  - Agent ❌ (not defined)
  - Storm ❌ (not defined)


ABOUT YOUR MARINE GAMEOBJECT:
==============================

You mentioned the player isn't showing - I need to clarify:

1. Where are you looking for the Marine?
   - In the Menu scene hierarchy?
   - In Play mode?
   - In the Game scene?

2. The Menu scene is loaded, which is the title screen
   - This scene typically doesn't have player GameObjects
   - Players spawn when you enter a game session

3. To test the crouch animations, you need to:
   - Open the GameS2 scene (not Menu scene)
   - Or start a multiplayer session from Menu
   - The Marine prefab spawns during gameplay


TESTING CROUCH IN GAME:
========================

Option 1: Test in GameS2 Scene
-------------------------------
1. In Project window, navigate to: Assets/TPSBR/Scenes/
2. Double-click: GameS2.unity
3. This will load the gameplay scene
4. Find your player in the hierarchy
5. Make sure it has:
   - Animator component with PlayerController assigned
   - CrouchSystem component
6. Press Play
7. Press C to crouch


Option 2: Test via Multiplayer Menu
------------------------------------
1. Stay in Menu scene
2. Press Play
3. Click "Play" button
4. Create or join a session
5. Once in-game, press C to crouch


WHY NO MARINE IN MENU SCENE:
=============================

The Menu scene is just UI - no gameplay objects.
The Marine prefab only spawns when:
  - You load a gameplay scene (like GameS2)
  - Or the network spawns it during multiplayer


NEXT STEPS:
===========

1. ✅ Console errors are fixed (no more spam)

2. To test crouch animations:
   - Load GameS2 scene
   - Or enter a multiplayer match
   - Press C to crouch

3. Make sure your Marine prefab has:
   - /Assets/TPSBR/Prefabs/Agents/Marine.prefab
   - Animator with PlayerController.controller
   - CrouchSystem component


CONSOLE IS NOW CLEAN:
======================

The only "errors" remaining are actually warnings:
  - FindObjectOfType deprecation warnings
  - These are harmless and just suggest using newer API
  - They don't affect gameplay


================================================================================
Console spam fixed! Test crouch in GameS2 scene or during multiplayer match.
