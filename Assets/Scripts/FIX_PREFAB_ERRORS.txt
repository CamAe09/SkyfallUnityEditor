HOW TO FIX THE 4 PREFAB ERRORS
================================================================================

GOOD NEWS: Your code compiled successfully! There are NO compilation errors!

The 4 "errors" are just Unity complaining about missing script references on prefabs.

AFFECTED PREFABS:
-----------------
1. Assets/TPSBR/Prefabs/Agents/Marine.prefab
2. Assets/TPSBR/Prefabs/Agents/AgentBase.prefab
3. Assets/TPSBR/Prefabs/Agents/Soldier.prefab
4. Assets/TPSBR/Prefabs/Agents/SolderCinematic.prefab


EASY FIX (30 seconds):
-----------------------

FOR EACH PREFAB:

1. In Unity Project window, navigate to: Assets/TPSBR/Prefabs/Agents/

2. Select the first prefab: Marine.prefab

3. In the Inspector, look for a component that says "Script (Missing)"
   It will have a red warning icon and say "The associated script can not be loaded"

4. Click the small "⚙" gear icon next to "Script (Missing)"

5. Select "Remove Component"

6. Repeat steps 2-5 for the other 3 prefabs:
   - AgentBase.prefab
   - Soldier.prefab
   - SolderCinematic.prefab

7. Save your scene (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S)


WHAT CAUSED THIS:
-----------------
Earlier we created/deleted some temporary files (CrouchSystem_UPDATED.cs, etc.)
If you had added that script to your prefabs, Unity kept a reference to it.
When the file was deleted, Unity can't find the script anymore.


AFTER THE FIX:
--------------
All errors will be gone! Your crouch system will be fully functional.

You can then add the CrouchSystem component to your agent prefabs:
1. Select Marine.prefab (or any agent prefab)
2. Click "Add Component"
3. Search for "CrouchSystem"
4. Add it
5. The component will auto-find the KCC


VERIFY EVERYTHING IS WORKING:
------------------------------
1. Check Console - should be clean (only warnings about FindObjectOfType, not errors)
2. Enter Play Mode - test crouching with C key
3. See CROUCH_ANIMATION_COMPLETE_GUIDE.txt for animation setup
