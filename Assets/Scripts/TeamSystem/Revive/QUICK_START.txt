   REVIVE SYSTEM - QUICK START GUIDE
========================================

✅ ALL ERRORS FIXED
✅ REVIVE SYSTEM READY

========================================
STEP 1: ADD TO GAME SCENE (2 minutes)
========================================

1. Open: Assets/TPSBR/Scenes/Game.unity

2. Find "GameSystems" GameObject (or create one)

3. Add these components:
   - ReviveIntegration
   - ReviveInteraction
   
4. Configure ReviveInteraction:
   - Set "Player Layer" to "Agent"

========================================
STEP 2: CREATE UI (5 minutes)
========================================

A) REVIVE PROMPT (for players reviving)
   
   Hierarchy:
   Canvas > Panel "RevivePrompt"
     - Text "PromptText" (set: "Hold [E] to Revive")
     - Text "PlayerNameText"
     - Image "ProgressFill" (Type: Filled, Fill: 0-1)
   
   Component: UIRevivePrompt
   Assign all references

B) DOWNED STATE (for downed players)
   
   Hierarchy:
   Canvas > Panel "DownedState"
     - Text "StatusText" (set: "You are down!")
     - Image "BleedOutFill" (Type: Filled)
     - Text "BleedOutTimer"
     - Panel "BeingRevived"
       - Text "ReviverNameText"
       - Image "ReviveProgress" (Type: Filled)
   
   Component: UIDownedState
   Assign all references

========================================
STEP 3: TEST (1 minute)
========================================

1. Start game with 2 players
2. Set team mode to Duo or Squad
3. Take fatal damage
4. You should:
   ✓ Crouch (can't shoot)
   ✓ See 30s timer
5. Teammate walks close
   ✓ Sees "Hold E" prompt
6. Teammate holds E for 5 seconds
   ✓ You're revived with 30 HP

========================================
OPTIONAL: DEBUG HELPER
========================================

Add "ReviveSystemDebugger" component to any GameObject

Debug Keys:
- K = Force downed state
- L = Force instant revive  
- P = Print status to console

========================================
SETTINGS (Optional)
========================================

Edit: /Assets/Scripts/TeamSystem/Revive/ReviveData.cs

Change these constants:
- REVIVE_DURATION = 5.0f (revive time in seconds)
- BLEED_OUT_DURATION = 30.0f (time until death)
- REVIVE_INTERACTION_DISTANCE = 2.5f (range in meters)
- REVIVE_HEALTH_RESTORED = 30f (HP after revive)

========================================
HOW IT WORKS
========================================

SOLO MODE:
- Death is instant (normal)
- No revive system

DUO/SQUAD MODE:
- Death → Downed state
- Player forced to crouch
- Cannot shoot/use items
- 30 second bleed-out timer
- Teammates can revive (hold E for 5s)
- If revived: 30 HP restored
- If not revived: permanent death

========================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
========================================

"Not entering downed state"
→ Check team mode is Duo/Squad (not Solo)
→ Verify ReviveIntegration is in scene

"Can't see revive prompt"
→ Check distance (within 2.5m)
→ Verify same team
→ Ensure E key is held (not tapped)

"UI not showing"
→ Assign all references in Inspector
→ Check Canvas is active
