HOW TO USE THE CROUCH ANIMATION SETUP TOOL
================================================================================

This tool automatically adds crouch animations to your Animator Controller!

STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE:
-------------------

STEP 1: Create a Crouch Animation Setup Asset
----------------------------------------------
1. In Unity, right-click in Project window
2. Navigate to: Create > TPSBR > Crouch Animation Setup
3. Name it: "CrouchAnimationSetup"
4. Click on it to select it


STEP 2: Assign Your Animation Clips
------------------------------------
In the Inspector for CrouchAnimationSetup:

1. Drag your CROUCH IDLE animation to "Crouch Idle" field
2. Drag your CROUCH WALK FORWARD animation to "Crouch Walk Forward" field
3. (Optional) Assign other crouch animations:
   - Crouch Walk Backward
   - Crouch Walk Left  
   - Crouch Walk Right
4. Adjust "Transition Duration" if needed (default: 0.2 seconds)


STEP 3: Open the Animator Setup Window
---------------------------------------
1. In Unity top menu, click: TPSBR > Setup Crouch Animations
2. A new window will appear: "Crouch Animator Setup"


STEP 4: Configure the Setup
----------------------------
In the Crouch Animator Setup window:

1. "Animation Controller" field:
   - Drag your Animator Controller (the one your character uses)
   - Usually found at: Assets/TPSBR/Animations/[YourCharacter]Controller
   
2. "Animation Setup" field:
   - Drag the CrouchAnimationSetup asset you created in Step 1

3. Click the big "SETUP CROUCH ANIMATIONS" button


STEP 5: Done!
-------------
The tool will automatically:
✅ Add "IsCrouching" bool parameter to your Animator
✅ Create a new "Crouch" layer
✅ Add crouch idle and movement states
✅ Create blend trees for smooth crouch movement
✅ Set up all transitions between standing and crouching


WHAT IF I DON'T HAVE CROUCH ANIMATIONS YET?
--------------------------------------------

Option 1: Use Placeholder Animations (Temporary)
- Assign your standing idle to "Crouch Idle"
- Assign your standing walk to "Crouch Walk Forward"
- Character will "crouch" but use standing animations
- Replace later with real crouch animations

Option 2: Get/Create Crouch Animations
- Download from Unity Asset Store
- Use Mixamo (free rigged character animations)
- Create your own in Blender/Maya
- Commission an animator

Option 3: Manual Setup (Advanced)
- See CROUCH_ANIMATION_COMPLETE_GUIDE.txt
- Manually add IsCrouching parameter
- Manually create states and transitions


TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------

❌ "Setup button is disabled"
   → Make sure you've assigned BOTH the Animator Controller AND Animation Setup

❌ "Couldn't find crouch animations"
   → Assign at least Crouch Idle and Crouch Walk Forward clips

❌ "IsCrouching parameter already exists"
   → No problem! Tool will skip creating it

❌ "Layer already exists"
   → Tool will tell you - you may need to manually merge or delete old layer


WHERE TO FIND YOUR ANIMATOR CONTROLLER:
---------------------------------------

For Marine character:
Assets/TPSBR/Animations/MarineController (or similar)

For Soldier character:
Assets/TPSBR/Animations/SoldierController (or similar)

Or search in Project window: "t:AnimatorController"


QUICK START (If You Have Animations Ready):
--------------------------------------------

1. Right-click > Create > TPSBR > Crouch Animation Setup
2. Assign your crouch animations to the asset
3. Menu: TPSBR > Setup Crouch Animations
4. Drag Animator Controller + Setup asset
5. Click "SETUP CROUCH ANIMATIONS"
6. Done! Test in Play Mode with C key
