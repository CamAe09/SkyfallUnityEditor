🎬 HOW TO CREATE YOUR ANIMATOR CONTROLLER
================================================================================

YOUR SITUATION:
---------------
✅ You have crouch animations ready
✅ You have Avatar Masks created
✅ You have an Avatar assigned
❌ You DON'T have an Animator Controller yet

This is actually NORMAL for a new character setup!
Let's create one together - it takes 30 seconds!


STEP-BY-STEP: CREATE THE ANIMATOR CONTROLLER
=============================================

STEP 1: Create the Controller
------------------------------

1. In Unity, go to Project window
2. Navigate to: Assets/TPSBR/Animations/
3. Right-click in empty space
4. Select: Create → Animator Controller
5. Name it: "MarineController"
6. Press Enter

✅ You now have an empty Animator Controller!


STEP 2: Assign it to Your Marine Prefab
----------------------------------------

1. In Project window, navigate to: Assets/TPSBR/Prefabs/Agents/
2. Double-click "Marine.prefab" to open it
3. In Hierarchy window, select the "Sci_Fi_Character_08_05" GameObject
   (This is the child object with the visual model)
4. In Inspector, find the "Animator" component
5. You'll see:
   - Controller: [Empty or None]
   - Avatar: [Should have something assigned]
6. Drag your new "MarineController" from Project window
   into the "Controller" field
7. Press Ctrl+S (Cmd+S on Mac) to save the prefab

✅ Your character now has an Animator Controller assigned!


STEP 3: Run the Automated Crouch Setup Tool
--------------------------------------------

NOW you can use the automated tool!

1. In Unity menu: TPSBR → Setup Crouch Animations
2. The tool window opens
3. Fill in:
   - Animator Controller: Drag "MarineController" here
   - Animation Setup: Drag "CrouchAnimationSetup" here
4. Click: "SETUP CROUCH ANIMATIONS"
5. Watch the Console for success message!

The tool will:
  ✅ Add IsCrouching parameter
  ✅ Create Crouch layer
  ✅ Add your crouch animations
  ✅ Set up all transitions
  ✅ Use your LowerBodyMask_Marine

└─────────────────────────────────────┘


WHERE TO FIND THINGS:
=====================

Your Avatar (already assigned):
  → Should be in the Animator component already
  → Probably extracted from the FBX model
  → Located somewhere like: Assets/TPSBR/Models/

Your Animations (already there):
  → Assets/TPSBR/Animations/Crouch/
  → Crouching Idle.fbx
  → Crouched Walking.fbx
  → Crouch Walk Back.fbx
  → Crouch Walk Left.fbx
  → Crouch Walk Right.fbx

Your Avatar Masks (already there):
  → Assets/TPSBR/Animations/Masks/
  → LowerBodyMask_Marine.mask ← For crouch layer
  → UpperBodyMask_Marine.mask ← For weapon layer

Your New Controller (you're about to create):
  → Assets/TPSBR/Animations/
  → MarineController.controller


OPTIONAL: Verify the Avatar
============================

Just to make sure your Avatar is properly set up:

1. Open Marine.prefab
2. Look at Animator component
3. Check the "Avatar" field
4. If it says "None":
   a. Find your character's FBX model
   b. Select it in Project window
   c. In Inspector, switch to "Rig" tab
   d. Set Animation Type: Humanoid
   e. Click "Apply"
   f. An Avatar will be created automatically
   g. Drag it to the Animator's Avatar field


WHAT IF I WANT TO ADD OTHER ANIMATIONS LATER?
==============================================

Once you have the controller:

For Standing Locomotion:
  1. Open MarineController in Animator window
  2. Select "Base Layer"
  3. Right-click → Create State → Empty
  4. Name it "Stand Idle"
  5. Drag your standing idle animation onto it
  6. Repeat for walk, run, jump, etc.

For Weapon Animations:
  1. Click "Layers" dropdown (top left)
  2. Click "+" to add new layer
  3. Name it "Upper Body"
  4. Set Weight to 1.0
  5. Click gear icon → Mask → Select "UpperBodyMask_Marine"
  6. Add weapon states (rifle hold, pistol hold, etc.)

For Shooting:
  1. Add another layer "Shoot"
  2. Set mask to UpperBodyMask_Marine
  3. Set Weight to 1.0
  4. Add shoot animations

But for NOW, just create the empty controller!
The crouch tool will add the Crouch layer automatically.


QUICK SUMMARY:
==============

Do this NOW:
  1. Right-click in Assets/TPSBR/Animations/
  2. Create → Animator Controller
  3. Name: "MarineController"
  4. Open Marine.prefab
  5. Drag controller to Animator component
  6. Save prefab
  7. Run the crouch setup tool!

That's it! 🎯


NEXT STEPS AFTER CREATING CONTROLLER:
======================================

Once you have MarineController created and assigned:

1. ✅ Run crouch setup tool
   → TPSBR → Setup Crouch Animations
   
2. ✅ Add CrouchSystem component
   → Open Marine.prefab
   → Add Component → CrouchSystem
   
3. ✅ Test in Play Mode
   → Press Play
   → Press C to crouch
   → Works!


TROUBLESHOOTING:
================

Q: Where is the Animator component on my prefab?
A: It should be on the child GameObject that has the mesh
   Usually named like "Sci_Fi_Character_08_05" or similar

Q: I created the controller but tool still says "None"
A: Make sure you DRAG it into the field, don't just click
   Or click the circle icon and select from list

Q: Avatar field is empty too!
A: Select your character's FBX → Rig tab → Humanoid → Apply
   Then drag the created Avatar to the field

Ready? Create that controller and let's get crouching working! 🚀
