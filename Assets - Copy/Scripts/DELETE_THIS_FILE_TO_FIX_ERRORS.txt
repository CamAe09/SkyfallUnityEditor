⚠️ IMPORTANT: DELETE THIS FILE TO FIX THE 9 ERRORS ⚠️

You're getting 9 compilation errors because of a duplicate file.

TO FIX THE ERRORS:

1. In Unity Project window
2. Navigate to: Assets/TPSBR/Scripts/UI/MenuViews/
3. Find the file: "UIShopView_Fixed.cs"
4. Right-click on it
5. Click "Delete"
6. Confirm deletion

That's it! All 9 errors will disappear.

WHY THIS HAPPENED:
I accidentally created a duplicate UIShopView class while fixing 
the null reference error. Both files define the same class name,
causing compilation conflicts.

WHICH FILE TO KEEP:
- ✅ KEEP: UIShopView.cs (the correct one)
- ❌ DELETE: UIShopView_Fixed.cs (the duplicate)

After deleting UIShopView_Fixed.cs, you can also delete this 
instruction file.
