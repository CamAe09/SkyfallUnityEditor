============================================================
✅ SPRINT SYSTEM - SETUP COMPLETE!
============================================================

Your sprint system has been successfully integrated! Here's what was done:

============================================================
CODE CHANGES COMPLETED:
============================================================

1. ✅ Agent.cs - Added Sprint System Integration
   - Added public Sprint property
   - Added private _sprint field
   - Initialized _sprint in Awake()
   - Added sprint processing in ProcessFixedInput()
   - Applied sprint speed multiplier to movement

2. ✅ AgentInput.Standalone.cs - Added Sprint Input Reading
   - Added line to read Left Shift key for sprinting
   - Sprint input is now captured from keyboard

3. ✅ BREnvironmentProcessor.cs - Added Speed Multiplier Property
   - Added public SpeedMultiplier property for dynamic speed changes

4. ✅ SprintSystem.cs - Already created (perfect!)
   - 7 second sprint duration
   - 7 second cooldown after sprint ends
   - 1.5x speed multiplier while sprinting
   - Networked for multiplayer

============================================================
FINAL STEP - ADD SPRINTSYSTEM COMPONENT TO AGENT PREFABS:
============================================================

You need to add the SprintSystem component to your Agent prefabs:

1. Open one of these prefabs in the Unity Editor:
   - Assets/TPSBR/Prefabs/Agents/AgentBase.prefab
   - Assets/TPSBR/Prefabs/Agents/Marine.prefab
   - Assets/TPSBR/Prefabs/Agents/Soldier.prefab

2. Select the root GameObject of the prefab

3. Click "Add Component" in the Inspector

4. Search for "Sprint System" and add it

5. Save the prefab

6. Repeat for all agent prefabs you're using

============================================================
HOW IT WORKS:
============================================================

1. Press and HOLD Left Shift to sprint
2. You'll move faster (1.5x speed) for up to 7 seconds
3. Release Left Shift OR wait 7 seconds to stop sprinting
4. After sprinting ends, you must wait 7 seconds before you can sprint again
5. Your UISprintIndicator will show the sprint/cooldown status

============================================================
TESTING:
============================================================

1. Add SprintSystem component to your agent prefabs (see above)
2. Enter Play Mode
3. Press Left Shift while moving - you should move significantly faster
4. The sprint will last for 7 seconds maximum
5. After it ends, you'll need to wait 7 seconds before sprinting again

============================================================
CUSTOMIZATION:
============================================================

To change sprint behavior, edit SprintSystem.cs constants:
- SPRINT_DURATION: How long you can sprint (default: 7 seconds)
- COOLDOWN_DURATION: How long before you can sprint again (default: 7 seconds)  
- SPRINT_SPEED_MULTIPLIER: Speed boost during sprint (default: 1.5x)
